<p><img src="img/stringer.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;" />The <strong>Wilson Baiardo</strong> is the biggest thing to happen to stringing machines in quite some time. It is the ultimate extension of Wilson’s campaign to demonstrate how committed it is to being the leader in the field of strings and stringing. It utilizes almost all the features available on the most expensive machines in the industry and a long list of features that can’t be found on any other stringing machine ever invented.</p>

<p>The Baiardo stringing machine doesn’t have riders, but it does automatically change its height to match its user and is designed with ergonomic features designed to make its users more comfortable than any stringing machine ever built.</p>
